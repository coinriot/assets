## What Did We Learn?
Of course, there’s no such thing as a perfect event, so we found a bunch of things we can improve on for HackSmart.

These include:
* Having a pre-hack week before the full hackathon competition starts to provide a ton of guidance and education to get attendees fully prepared.
* Doing even more to make team-forming an easier process.
* Even more fun and games!
* Make sure that mentors have enough time to provide plenty of support to the teams.
